# SCMG5

In the era of modern times technology has become vital to everyone. People tend to use software in almost every activities of their daily life. Software Configuration Management (SCM) plays a prominent role in ensuring tracking and controlling changes in the software, part of the larger cross-disciplinary field of configuration management. SCM has six main core functions; Source Code Management, Build Engineering, Environment Configuration, Change Control, Release Management and Deployed.

Github is used as a tool to distribute the version control and source code management functionality of Git as well as adding its own features. Github is a web-based Git repository hosting service. It provides access control and several collaboration features such as bug tracking, feature requests and task management.

Based on this mini project, we start by uploading the source code into the repository. Then, we compile by merging the source code continuing by test the build on other web browser. Next, we will make some changes in the code and release the code. Lastly, we will deploy into the Cloud Post.
